# Abstract
This project presents a creative AI pipeline that transforms a single-word prompt into a mini comic experience by combining natural language generation and image synthesis. The system uses the FLAN-T5 model to generate short, humorous, and unexpected comic-style stories in 2â€“3 lines based on a user-provided keyword. The resulting story is then visualized using the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model, which converts the text into a vivid image that captures the tone and scene of the story. The entire process runs on a GPU-backed pipeline using PyTorch, enabling efficient story creation and rendering. This project showcases the fusion of text-to-text and text-to-image AI models for playful content generation and highlights the power of generative AI in storytelling and digital art.
